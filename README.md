# Clipboard DOOM (...the copy-paste one)

*This is a Doom source port that copies to clipboard and pastes from clipboard at full 30 FPS*

...though I'm not entirely sure why anyone would want their computer to do that. It's like if you took all those demons and monsters and things from Doom, and instead of letting them live in the computer like normal demons, you make them exist by copying and pasting them over and over, which when you think about it is probably exhausting for the demons. 

Imagine having to be copied and pasted 30 times every second - that's more copying and pasting than my nan's done in her entire life, and she works at an office. 

Ps. You might want to save your documents first, unless you want your important work mixed up with hell demons, which actually might make your quarterly reports more interesting when you think about it.

## TODO: 
- Should I let people live-stream it in a shared Google Doc? Sometimes I wonder if a Google person is watching everything we type, like that time I searched for "why do clouds stay up" and then my phone showed me adverts for ladders. 
- Should make Word not crash after 3 seconds. Speaking of seconds, isn't it weird how time keeps going forward? You never hear about time going sideways
- Figure out why demons come through the clipboard. Maybe that's where all the copied text goes when you copy over it - to a demon dimension where all the forgotten words live
Check if game runs better when you're wearing headphones. Not for the sound, just because headphones make you look more like you're doing proper computer things
Sometimes when I paste things my computer makes that little ding noise, like it's proud of itself. Wonder if the demons hear that ding too. Must be annoying for them
- Need to test if running DOOM through Excel makes the demons arrange themselves into pie charts. Though why do they call them pie charts when they look nothing like actual pie? That's probably why computers are so confused all the time
Have to see if the game works in emails. But then again, what even is email? Like, where does it go between pressing send and it arriving? Probably the same place socks go in the washing machine
- TODO: Remember what I was supposed to TODO in the first place. Life's like that sometimes, isn't it? You start doing one thing and end up thinking about how bananas don't look anything like their trees
Test if copying and pasting makes the demons tired from all the jumping between documents. Must be exhausting, like how my nan gets tired from watching too much television
- Need to check if running the game through Zoom makes the demons have to worry about if they're on mute or not. Imagine being a demon and someone keeps telling you "you're on mute" but you're not even trying to talk, you're trying to eat someone's soul
- Should probably test what happens if you paste DOOM into a document about DOOM. Would it be like when you point a camera at its own screen and it goes all weird and infinite? Makes you think about parallel universes
Have to see if the game works in dark mode. Though why do they call it dark mode when the screen's still lit up? It's like calling a torch "dark mode" just because it's black plastic

## Known Issues (or Things That Keep Happening That Nobody Really Understands Why)
Sometimes when you're trying to shoot the demons, the computer thinks you're trying to shoot demos instead, which is strange because demos are just things people show you at work when they want to sell you something. Although when you think about it, maybe the computer knows something we don't - has anyone ever seen a demon and a demo in the same room?

Some people say their computers keep pasting bits of demons even after they've turned them off and on again. It's like the demons have learned to hide in that place where the computer keeps things when it's sleeping. Makes you wonder where exactly things go when you turn a computer off. They must go somewhere.

Important: You should probably save your documents before playing this, because pasting 30 pictures of demons every second is a lot of work for your computer, and it might get confused and start mixing up your important work emails with bits of hell. Though that might actually make some emails better.

This repository is licensed under the GNU GPL v2, which is one of those serious computer rules that make sure everything's proper and legal. GNU is quite important in computers, a bit like how we have the United Nations for countries, except GNU is for when bits of computer code want to visit other computers. The GPL part stands for General Public License, because it's for the general public, which is basically everyone except computers.

And the v2 means it's been checked twice, which is good because you want to be extra sure when you're dealing with demons, even if they're just computer ones. Though it does make you wonder - if a computer demon copies itself onto your clipboard, who actually owns it? The person who made the demon, or the clipboard that's keeping it safe?
